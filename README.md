#### This application is designed to assist the blind by offering numerous advantages, including:
1. The ability to engage in video calls with volunteers who provide assistance.
2. The capability to recognize different categories of Egyptian currencies.
3. The capability to recognize english text and say it as voice.
4. The feature to identify various elements such as people, trees, fire, cars, potholes in the road, and aggressive dogs.
5. The option to select from a wide range of colors to help the user visualize and coordinate their clothing with other elements.
6. The function to verbally announce the current time and date.
7. The ability to save notes and listen to them at any time.
8. The option to save mobile numbers, create a list of favorite contacts, and make calls through voice commands.
One of the most important features of the application is its ability to execute commands with a single click. When navigating through the application's pages, the blind person can easily determine their location by listening to the accompanying sound cues.
